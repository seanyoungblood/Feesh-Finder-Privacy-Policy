Privacy Policy
              
Effective Date: 10/22/2025
              
Youngblood Software, LLC ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Feesh Finder app ("App"). This privacy policy outlines the information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect your privacy when using our App.
              
Information Collection and Use
Feesh Finder does not collect any personal information about the user or their device. The only information you provide is the data you submit directly through the app. This data is processed by AI models to generate predictions, but it is never stored or retained by us.

Firebase & Firestore
We use Firebase Authentication to manage user accounts. Firebase may store your UID, email, and password (if provided) to allow you to log in. This information is stored securely by Google and is not accessible by us in a personally identifiable manner. Passwords are hashed by Firebase. We create a user document in Firestore when you register, which currently contains no personal information and is used solely to manage your account within the app.
              
Google AdMob
Feesh Finder uses Google AdMob to display ads within the app. AdMob may collect certain information about users for the purpose of providing personalized ads. This data may include, but is not limited to, information such as device identifiers, location, and app usage. For more information on how Google collects and processes data, please refer to their Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy.
              
Data Retention
We do not store any personal information submitted by users except the data mentioned in the Firebase section to allow you to log in. All other user data is processed in real-time and discarded immediately after the process is complete. Account data stored in Firebase and Firestore is retained until you delete your account.
              
Security
We take reasonable precautions to protect your information. Data stored in Firebase and Firestore is protected by Firebase and Firestore rules in addition to server-side and client-side security measures. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee its absolute security.
              
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will post the updated policy in this section with a new effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
